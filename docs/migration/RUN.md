# BoardStudio milestone continuation

Run base: `96dd51d3e790c28f5554a8c9888a147c8814e2a7`.
Coordinator worktree: `/tmp/boardstudio-migration-specs-review-20261001`.
Branch: `docs/boardstudio-migration-specs-review` (existing protected worktrees
are read-only inputs). Accepted scope: [map](../../CAPABILITY-MAP.md) and
[ADR 0003](../adr/0003-rust-application-ownership.md).

## Authorization

The 2026-10-01 request first authorizes remaining module specifications,
technical validation and execution preflight. No implementation task set
existed when that request arrived. The subsequent user instruction,
**“Assume everything is approved in advance”**, removes routine phase/progress
approval pauses within this defined milestone. The later **“Install it ...?”**
explicitly authorizes installing the selected Dioxus CLI.

Record each exact spec/plan revision and bounded task set before its execution.
Advance approval is applied to those defined tasks, not a claim that undefined
future migration work has been specified. Continue safely through their graph;
actual failed gates, incompatible data or invalidated architecture still block
dependent work. No push, deployment, main merge, protected-worktree writes,
unauthorized model/provider switch or automatic prototype promotion is allowed.

## Current task set

| Task | Exact scope / authority | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DOC-1 | Complete and technically validate the six mapped M1 specs; preserve accepted inputs | Complete: reviewed and integrated `47d6dbce`; documentation checks only |
| TOOL-1 | Install official Dioxus CLI **0.7.10** selected by ADR 0003; verify official digest and `dx --version`; add a command link only if absent | Complete: official archive digest and `dioxus 0.7.10 (57d6794)` verified, exit 0 |
| P1 | Existing worker/CAD packaging charter; exact bounded [P1-r1](../../tasks/plan.md), task set P1-CORE → P1-CAD in root TODO | Authorized in advance; P1-CORE eligible after reviewed DOC-1 integration |

TOOL-1 may write only its project-owned tool directory under
`/home/chris/.local/share/boardstudio/tools/dioxus-cli/0.7.10`, an absent
`/home/chris/.local/bin/dx` link, and this run's download/log/evidence paths.
Do not overwrite an existing executable or change PATH/config. Use the official
x86_64 Linux archive and published SHA-256; no provider/model is involved.

## Preflight evidence and limits

Codex CLI 0.159.3 and strict-config doctor load succeed. Actual configuration
contains a three-thread limit and Luna/high subagent defaults. The smoke request
used Luna/medium; state DB and stored turn context independently confirm both.
The source inventory used Luna/medium and performed no writes.
[Observable metadata](../../.scratch/migration-specs-validation/subagent-preflight.json)
retains the evidence; agent self-identification was not used as routing proof.

Current execution has never/danger-full-access permissions, and new-worktree
creation succeeds without changing them. Doctor describes its standalone
invocation sandbox, not active-thread overrides; actual tool operations are
the stronger evidence. Git, Cargo/Rust 1.98.0, pnpm 12.6.0, Node, wasm-pack,
Chromium 153 and agent-browser are available. A task-owned Chromium about:blank
open/snapshot/close succeeds. This proves launch capability, not application
browser acceptance. Dioxus CLI was absent before TOOL-1.

`codex --strict-config features list` is unsupported (exit 1); the diagnosed
fallback `codex --strict-config doctor --json` succeeds (exit 0) and validates
configuration load. Doctor retains a pre-existing rollout/DB parity warning;
no configuration or state repair is performed.

Closing threads is a capability limitation: `codex archive` for the completed
smoke thread returns exit 1. The collaboration interface exposes no close-thread
operation. Preserve completed results and do not mutate the Codex state DB or
spawn beyond three total open child threads. This may constrain delegation;
it does not block coordinator documentation/tool installation.

Official Dioxus latest release is rechecked as stable v0.7.10. Tagged CLI build,
target and web configuration sources verify build/base-path flags. Some web
retrievals fail; authoritative GitHub HTTP retrieval succeeds instead. Records:
[official-source checks](../../.scratch/migration-specs-validation/official-source-checks.json).

All inherited failed/unavailable checks and five missing historical report
links remain in the assessment. This run does not reinterpret them as green.
Task-specific commands, candidates/reviews, attempts and integration status
will be appended here before declaring any executable task accepted.

TOOL-1 evidence: [install record](../../.scratch/migration-specs-validation/tool-install.json).
Official archive SHA-256 is
`4363e4ed2a3f1eb7f4d38d2d59aed59ce43271c44c16b425e92c89a64761fbe7`;
the command link resolves to the project-owned versioned installation. No PATH
or configuration change, source build or existing-binary overwrite was needed.

## DOC-1 accepted revision and next task

Exact candidate/review/integration: `47d6dbce5af2285d1f886ef63d2d4c7b1de57925`,
reviewed by the fresh Luna/high reviewer against `38bbe42f`. The stale approval
sentence was corrected and re-reviewed. Repository check passes (553 authored,
369 reachable); whitespace and 145 local-link checks pass. Two diagnosed
checker repairs were used: provision fresh-worktree dependencies with frozen
lockfile, then relocate copied historical links to their original read-only
inputs. No checker or quality requirement was weakened.

Dedicated integration worktree: `/tmp/boardstudio-migration-m1-20261001`, branch
`migration/boardstudio-m1`. Fast-forward integration preserves the exact candidate.
The integrated repository check and whitespace check exit 0. See the
[review/integration record](../../.scratch/migration-specs-validation/doc-review-integration.json).
The five other specs and the editor-session spec are technically reviewed;
their runtime acceptance criteria remain unexecuted.

Next eligible task: **P1-CORE**, plan **P1-r1**, the six specs and ADR at the exact
reviewed commit above. Authority is the recorded advance approval plus local
commit/integration authorization. Prototype-only path ownership is
`.scratch/prototypes/p1-core/`; no production adoption. Coordinator implementation
is used because all three existing child threads are retained and native closure
is unavailable; the non-authoring reviewer remains available for exact-candidate
review. A new task-owned worktree is created and checked before any prototype
edit. P1-CAD depends on accepted P1-CORE; P2/P3 remain outside this task set.

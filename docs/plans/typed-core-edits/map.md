# Map: Typed Core edits

Label: wayfinder:map
Spec: [spec.md](spec.md) · Decision: [ADR-0006](../../adr/0006-replace-document-for-import-and-recovery.md)

## Destination

Product edits are typed Core intents that state what they change; Core owns their rules
and reports precise changed IDs. `ReplaceDocument` is used only for import and recovery
and for any bulk action a recorded decision permits.

## Notes

- Domain terms: [CONTEXT.md](../../../CONTEXT.md) (accepted document, pending edit,
  field edit, one-shot action).
- Skills: `tdd` for build tickets, `codebase-design` for operation and seam shape,
  `grilling` + `domain-modeling` for decisions, `code-review` before resolving.
- Tracker conventions: [docs/agents/issue-tracker.md](../../agents/issue-tracker.md).
- Starts after edit settlement's
  [ticket 20](../edit-settlement/issues/20-preview-only-direct-edit-event.md), which
  also edits Session's event types.

## Decisions so far

- `ReplaceDocument` is reserved for import and recovery as the direction, no
  enforcement date; archive open/import and recovery reopen, footprint import and
  routed-board reference upload are permitted by name:
  [ADR-0006](../../adr/0006-replace-document-for-import-and-recovery.md).
- The first slice is the smallest bounded demonstration, `SetWiringMode`, to settle
  the pattern before larger concepts copy it:
  [edit settlement ticket 19](../edit-settlement/issues/19-decide-first-typed-core-edits.md#answer).
- Only the first ticket is specified; the next ones are sliced after it lands, from what
  it settled.

## Progress

<!-- one line per resolved build ticket -->

## Not yet specified

From the [resolver inventory](../edit-settlement/replace-document-resolvers.md). Each
becomes a typed intent, a typed batch intent, or a decision to add it to ADR-0006's
permitted list.

- [`SetWiringMode`](issues/01-set-wiring-mode.md) (specified, first).
- Project and board renames (setup guide, Library, board inspector): likely next;
  two small operations replacing three resolvers.
- Outline version features and active-version settings: strongest outline-rule
  duplication; broader semantics (identity, validity, version-only storage).
- Wiring/net: part-net assignment and the reviewed wiring plan, likely one typed batch
  intent with atomic identity.
- Layout membership and placement: atomic assign-to-layout, part/controller placement.
- Keycap resize plan: check whether existing keycap operations already express it.
- Parts definitions: rename, field patch, new component, models, assemblies, generator
  apply and upload.
- PCB part input settings, pin locks and board-reference edits.
- Bulk actions needing a typed batch intent or a permitted-list decision: physical
  setup, geometry-script apply, generator apply and model upload, assembly placement,
  reviewed wiring plan, matrix and mirrored-half creation, board creation.

## Out of scope

- Enforcing the import-and-recovery restriction (a later decision once the bulk actions
  are classified).
- Smaller or finer-grained Undo history.

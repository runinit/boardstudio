# 38: Merge the duplicate browser tests the audit named

Status: ready-for-agent
Type: build
Blocked by: [37](37-sleeps-layout-library-ui-page.md)
Spec: [spec.md](../spec.md) · Map: [map.md](../map.md) · Audit: [test-audit.md](../audit/test-audit.md)

## Request

Continue ticket [34](34-test-speed-browser.md): replace fixed settle loops with `wait_until` (`web/crates/ui-shared/src/test_wait.rs`) in the suites named below. The keymap
`queued_edit_tests` pilot took that suite from 37.0 s to about 9.7 s with the assertion count and test names unchanged. Pattern to follow: each wait checks the precondition the next
assertion needs (including a `rendered_accepted`-style wait for the accepted revision before an action); every wait is bounded; no test depends on elapsed time except that bound; unbounded
`.await` gates in these tests get a bounded variant.

## What to do

- Audit M2: merge the keymap keycode/delay twin tests into table-driven tests. Audit M3: merge the probable duplicate position-draft tests in the presentation inspector tests. Re-read both bodies first and merge ONLY exact duplicates; list what each merge preserves; skip any that are not exact. Update the audit with a phase 2 results section and close ticket [24](24-test-audit.md) together with [35](35-test-maintenance-cuts.md).

## Acceptance

- [ ] Per-suite before/after table in the Outcome; `browser` three consecutive passing runs; executed test names equal the baseline except deliberate merges (diff the crate `--list` outputs before/after).
- [ ] Mutation checks: three representative waits per ticket made never-true fail with the helper's message within the bound; the production step each depends on removed makes the test fail fast.

## Verification

`repo lint typecheck browser` (sandbox lifted for wasm-pack and Chrome), run three times. Process: [verification-process.md](../../../agents/verification-process.md). Time box about two hours.
